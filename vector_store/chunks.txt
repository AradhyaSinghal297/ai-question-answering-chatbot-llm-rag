Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. Each training example consists of an input and a known correct output. Classification and regression are common supervised learning tasks. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The system tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data. Clustering and association are examples of unsupervised learning.
